# StoreApplication

### Application to store and interact with the data saved in a session

### I have added various features that we had not done in class:
- 1- Delete all button only when there is when there is a minimum, a product
- 2- Modal window to confirm the deletion of all products
- 3- If nothing has been changed in the edit, it stays in the same path and skips a message
- 4- Delete modal for each product, in which you get the product to be deleted and its id
- 5- id auto generated maximum
- 6- One more resource (price)
- 7- And more different implementations...
